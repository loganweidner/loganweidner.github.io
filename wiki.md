![ESRI Web GIS Image](imgs/house.jpg)

I have recently been house sitting for a family that has been visiting Japan for the past month. I'll be writing a wiki page here just in case something happens to me. with this, hopefully anyone would be able to take up my house sitting duties without a hitch.


## List of Duties
The job is pretty easy, the following is an *exhaustive* list of what is expected of you:
- Feed Cats
- Change Litter Box
- Water Plants

### Feeding the Cats
The cats have automatic feeders, so you will not need to be there at their feeding times of 6:00 am and 6:00 pm. The only thing you need to do is **make sure the feeders are not empty**. This is not difficult, as the feeders have a small window that allows you to see how much food is in them. If they are running low, you can top off their food useing the **bad of cat food in the kitchen closet**
### Changing the Litter Box
The cats' litter box is right **upstairs behind the divider**. Every couple of days or so you can use the bags on the shelf next to the litter box and the slotted scoop to scoop in any clumps from the litter box to the bag, then throw said bag into the trash outside
### Watering the Plants
**Every couple of days** you should use the **bottle by the kitchen sink** to water the plants. There are many plants of varying sizes, but essentially the rule to follow is to **hydrate the soil well, but make sure there's no excess pooling above the soil line**. There are 4 large pots on the floor by the rightmost kitchen window, those ones only really need to be watered once a week.

## Cleaning Supplies
Should there be a mess anywhere for whatever reason, you can find most cleaning slupplies you need either **under the sink** or **behind the litterbox**. Any sort of paper supplies you may need can be found **just inside the door to the garage**, and the vaccuum is **across the hallway from the litterbox**
